## Architecture

The application uses a three-tier architecture:

1. **Vue 3 Frontend** (this repository)
   - Single-page application with client-side routing
   - Communicates with backend via REST API
   - Handles rich text editing and real-time preview

2. **REST API Backend** (separate repository)
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Flashcard and collection data persistence
   - Django REST Framework with token authentication

3. **PDF Rendering Service** (separate service)
   - Converts HTML to PDF with custom page sizes
   - Supports KaTeX math rendering
   - Receives structured JSON with page HTML and dimensions
